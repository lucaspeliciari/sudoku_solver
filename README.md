# sudoku_solver
Simple C++ script that tries to solve a sudoku puzzle.<br>
It first tries to solve it without any guesses.<br>
If it fails to do that, it will run a backtracking algorithm.

<p>Puzzle must be given as a command line argument, with zeroes representing empty spaces.</p>
Use -l to save each step of the solving process to a txt.
